# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to master the principles and methodology of **Requirement Analysis** by building a detailed blueprint for the requirement analysis phase of a **Booking Management System** (Airbnb clone).

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the development team gathers, analyzes, and defines the software requirements. It ensures that all stakeholders share a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding:** Aligns expectations among stakeholders.
- **Scope Definition:** Prevents scope creep by defining clear boundaries.
- **Foundation for Design & Development:** Provides a solid base for later phases.
- **Time & Cost Estimation:** Helps in realistic project planning.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the final product meets user needs via acceptance criteria.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect detailed information using:
  - Interviews  
  - Surveys/Questionnaires  
  - Document Analysis  
  - Workshops  
  - Observation

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Extract deeper requirements through:
  - Brainstorming  
  - Focus group discussions  
  - Prototyping to visualize and refine ideas

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Create detailed artifacts such as:
  - Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
  - User Stories  
  - Use Case Diagrams

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Prioritize and analyze requirements by:
  - Performing feasibility studies (technical, financial, time)  
  - Creating visual models like Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensure accuracy through:
  - Review and approval processes  
  - Defining clear Acceptance Criteria  
  - Using Traceability Matrices to track requirement implementation

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Describe what the system should do.

- Users can search for hotels by location, date, and price.
- Users can book rooms with details and payment.
- Users can view current and past bookings.
- Hotel owners can create, update, and delete listings.
- Admins can manage users and property data.
- Users can register, log in, and manage profiles.

### Non-functional Requirements

Describe how the system performs.

- **Performance:** Search results load within 2 seconds.
- **Scalability:** Supports over 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security:** Encrypt data and follow OWASP best practices.
- **Availability:** Maintain 99.9% uptime.
- **Usability:** Fully responsive and easy to navigate.
- **Maintainability:** Modular architecture for easy updates.

---##  Use Case Diagrams

###  What Are Use Case Diagrams?

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation used in **requirement analysis** to capture the functional aspects of a system. It illustrates how **actors** (users or external systems) interact with the system and what functionalities (use cases) the system provides.

###  Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Clarifies system requirements and boundaries.
- Identifies primary system users and their goals.
- Helps developers and stakeholders understand interactions.
- Supports communication between technical and non-technical team members.
- Serves as a foundation for designing and testing the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by the product owner or stakeholders. They clarify what needs to be done and ensure quality delivery.

### Why Acceptance Criteria Matter

- Define ‚Äúdone‚Äù for each feature.
- Serve as a basis for testing and validation.
- Clarify expectations early.
- Ensure user-centered functionality.

### Example: Checkout Feature

**Feature:** Complete Booking Checkout

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] User can review booking details before confirming.
- [ ] User must enter valid payment information.
- [ ] Payment is securely validated and processed.
- [ ] User receives a confirmation message with reference.
- [ ] Booking is saved and viewable in user profile.
